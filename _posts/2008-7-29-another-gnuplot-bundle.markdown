Whilst surfing [GitHub](http://github.com/ "Secure Git hosting and collaborative development &mdash; GitHub"), the new standard repository for all of the World's
cool repositories, I stumbled across
[gnuplot-textmate-bundle](http://github.com/pieter/gnuplot-textmate-bundle/tree/master "pieter's gnuplot-textmate-bundle at master &mdash; GitHub") -- another Gnuplot bundle for TextMate. 

So far I've only had time for a quick look, but my initial thoughts are that it is less complete than my bundle, but with better commands. Their run command uses a [ruby helper script](http://github.com/pieter/gnuplot-textmate-bundle/tree/master/Support/GnuplotMate.rb "Support/GnuplotMate.rb at master from pieter's gnuplot-textmate-bundle &mdash; GitHub"), which looks quite cool. There's also some usefulness in the form of a [Rake](http://github.com/pieter/gnuplot-textmate-bundle/tree/master/Support/Gnuplot.rake "Support/Gnuplot.rake at master from pieter's gnuplot-textmate-bundle &mdash; GitHub") script. Most of it seems to focus on eps files though, which isn't really general enough for me, but it looks quite robust. In particular, I like the idea of stripping out the `output` parts for previewing in [aquaterm](http://sourceforge.net/projects/aquaterm/ "SourceForge.net: AquaTerm (Mac OS X graphics terminal)").

Anyway, there's some cool ideas there, and as a scary professor I know one saidâ€¦ "We don't work in a vacuum, you know."
