I'm pretty sure that in a parallel universe there's a version of me who's a
metal guitarist. I love music, despite knowing nothing about it technically and
I spend most of my waking hours listening to rock and metal. 

So, in a break from regular programming (haha, there's nothing regular about my
posting), heres's a post about some delicious dark music I've discovered and
enjoyed in the last year -- in no particular order. I've only
covered a few albums, so this list is nowhere near complete, but I like the
idea about writing about music, so may do it more.

## Mammoth Storm - Fornjot

First off, here's some [Stoner Doom Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_metal#Stoner_doom) (yes, that's totally a thing). 
Mammoth Storm is slow, ponderous and extremely heavy, with epic buildups and hypnotic riffs. 
Their full length album, [Fornjot](https://itun.es/gb/Co-P9) easily one of my
favourite releases of 2015, and I find this great background music when I need
to concentrate.

## Riverside - Love, Fear and the Time Machine

Riverside's albums get less heavy over time, but definitely no less brilliant. I'd be
lying if I said I didn't miss the heavier albums of a few years ago, like 
[ADHD](https://itun.es/gb/i5cv-), but this album feels a bit more grown up, and is excellent. 

## Author & Punisher - Melk En Honning 

[Melk En Honning](https://itun.es/gb/pbgk7) reminds me of The Fragile, by NiN.
In that it's EXTREMELY heavy. I know little about this artist,
but their [bandcamp page](https://authorandpunisher.bandcamp.com/) says they
use specially made instruments, and this come across in the industrial
sounding feel of the music. 

## Paradise Lost - The Plague Within

This is my favourite Paradise Lost album for years! I love the mixture old
oldschool vocals and clean singing from earlier albums and the classic guitar
sounds are still there. Nick Holmes' time singing for Bloodbath really helped
with the quality of this album, and my favourite track is 
[Flesh From Bone](https://itun.es/gb/hia--?i=1056440848).

## Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard - Noeth Ac Anoeth

Don't let the ridiculous name put you off! [Noeth Ac Anoeth](https://itun.es/gb/Lhdb-)
is awesome Stoner Doom metal with positively angelic vocals. The female vocals
make this really different from other bands in the same genre, and while I
discovered it late in the year, I've been listening to it a lot.

## Marilyn Manson - The Pale Emperor

I spent a fair amount of time earlier last year with [this album](https://itun.es/gb/r0oU3)
on repeat. It sounds great played loud, through actual speakers, and while it's
not at all like any of his previous albums, I think this is Marilyn Manson's
best album for a good few years.

## Leprous - The Congregation 

I really love Leprous, and I've only recently found any other bands with such
striking vocals (see Agent Fresco, below). 
[The Congregation](https://itun.es/gb/ap2A-) is great, but as lots of online reviews
have said, somehow less striking and progressive than
[Coal](https://itun.es/gb/0mYu-), their previous album.

Still, don't let that stop you listening because it's still awesome. 
If you need any convincing that this album is worth a listen, just watch the
video for the opening track, The Price:

## Gazpacho - Molok

This post is dragging on, but I can't even start to wrap it up without
mentioning one of my favourite Norwegian "Art-Prog" bands, Gazpacho. I always
find their music takes a few listens to really sink in and become enjoyable, 
but once you cross that threshold you'll become hooked. 
[Molok](https://itun.es/gb/keSg-) is no exception. Some of the concepts covered
in the album are crazy, so I encourage you to search the web and read about it!

## Finding new music

Apart from clicking about on streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify,
which are great sources of new things to listen to, there are a few blogs I
recommend if you're into 'dark' music, like the more experimental side of rock
and metal.

### Dark Hemyspheres

[Dark Hemyspheres](http://music.thedigitalfix.com/column/dark-hemyspheres) is a
monthly column which rounds up recent releases. I never know how the author
picks what he reviews, but it's an excellent source of new music. In December
2015, for example it reviewed Sunn O)))'s amazing [Kannon](https://itun.es/gb/8og9-) album, 
and [Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard](https://itun.es/gb/Nhdb-), which is alo excellent.

### Radio Fenriz

[Radio Fenriz](https://soundcloud.com/heavytassen), by _the_
[Fenriz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenriz) from
[Darkthrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkthrone) covers a massive amount
of music, a lot of which is excellent. [Episode 9](https://soundcloud.com/heavytassen/radio-fenriz-9-2015) 
was my favourite last year, and it covered things ranging from
[Avatarium](http://avatariumofficial.se/) to [Ecstatic Vision](https://ecstaticvision.bandcamp.com/), which I love. Check it out. Just
don't send in any more demos.

### Heavy Blog is Heavy

[Heavy Blog](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/) does an excellent job of
covering less common heavy music. In fact, it might do too good a job, and I
end up with hundreds of posts in my RSS reader. Their 
[Top 50 Albums of 2015](http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2015/12/21/heavy-blogs-top-50-albums-of-2015/) 
is full of great albums, like [Myrkur's M](https://itun.es/gb/elhk7), 
[Leprous - The Congregation](https://itun.es/gb/ap2A-), 
and [Agent Fresco, with Destrier](https://itun.es/gb/Ym907). This is a good
site to flick through until something catches your eye, and then listen to it.

## Wrap up

I've been thinking about writing a post about music for a while now, and now I have.
Hopefully, if you've stumbled here because of an artist you know you'll find something else
you like. I've tried to include a range of different types of music, but know I
don't listen to that broad a range of styles -- there literally is just too much to listen to.
