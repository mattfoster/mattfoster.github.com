I was lucky enough to visit Newcastle Upon Tyne for the Makerfaire_uk this March, and since then I've been brimming with ideas, and feeling the need to make things. This post is partially here to demonstrate that I am, in fact, still alive, and to show off a couple of little things I've made.

First, I got a [p8tch](http://www.p8tch.com/ "P8tch: welcome"). This self proclaimed commando nerd patch is an embroidered QR code, which links to a configurable tinyurl style redirect. My first act of making was to sew this onto my [Timbuk2 Hacker](http://www.timbuk2.co/tb2/products/backpacks/hacker "Timbuk2 Bags - Hacker Daypack - Ballistic Fabric") bag. Here's a picture of the result:

Unfortunately, I don't have QR enabled phone (yet), but I tested it by stealing my mothers :).

Next, whilst in Newcastle, at the Makerfaire (during time which I snapped some [pics](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattfoster/sets/72157615228193893/ "Makerfaire UK - a set on Flickr")). I bought a [tvbgone](http://www.ladyada.net/make/tvbgone/ "TV-B-Gone Kit - DIY Universal Remote") kit, which I built. This is a subversive little thing which switches of TVs. Lots of them. It also has a range of about 45 metres, and knows 46 different IR remote control codes. I intend to have a lot of fun switching off TVs in shops with this. Here's a macro shot I took using a screw on +10 filter, and my 50 mm lens:

In other news, I hope to start posting content to [zshbits.com](http://zshbits.com "ZSH Bits: a tutorial and reference site for ZSH") once I've finished my thesis, and had time to create some more screencasts. If anyone's interested in contributing, mail me, or comment with disqus.
