Git is one of those programs, like, say [vim](http://www.vim.org/ "welcome home : vim online"), which contains more functionality than it seems humanly possible to grasp. Thankfully, there are sites like [gitready](http://gitready.com/ "git ready &raquo; daily tips for the noob to the guru"), which are designed to help us mere mortals to grasp the awesomeness.

I'm very pleased to be able to report that a bit of awesomeness that I've been involved in has been listed. Have a look at the [ZSH Git Status](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/01/28/zsh-git-status.html "git ready &raquo; zsh git status") page and you might see what I mean. That's right: zshkit is mentioned.

If you've not read any of my other posts on it, zshkit is a project, started by [Bryce "BonzoESC" Kerley](http://brycekerley.net/chronicle/ "Bryce Kerley"), and forked by various people (I think I just had the honour of being the furthest up the [network](http://github.com/bkerley/zshkit/network "The zshkit Network - GitHub") graph). 

Over the next few days, I'm hoping to implement the `vcs_info` stuff mentioned in the [git-ready](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/01/28/zsh-git-status.html "git ready &raquo; zsh git status") comments.
