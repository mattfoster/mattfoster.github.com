It's probably impossible to go to a conference without picking up some kind of idea of the current trends in the areas being discussed. IGARSS 2008 was certainly no exception. Here's a list of what I think were probably the most *trendy* techniques in remote sensing. You can probably make a list like this just by graphing the frequency of word use:

 * Classification
   * [Support Vector Machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine "Support vector machine - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")
   * Markov segmentation
 * [geostatistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics "Geostatistics - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") - Last time I looked at wikipedia's geostatistics entry it was very highly biased. Watch out!
 * [Kriging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging "Kriging - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") -- less mentioned, but heavily used.
 * [Pan-sharpening](http://www.geosage.com/highview/imagefusion.html "Image fusion and pan-sharpening: the big picture")
 * [mathematical morphology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_image_processing "Mathematical morphology - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") - Although interestingly, nothing as modern as attribute morphology.
 
And trendy instrument types:

 * [Hyperspectral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral "Hyperspectral imaging - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")-anything!
 * [Synthetic Aperture Radar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_aperture_radar "Synthetic aperture radar - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") SAR
 * [LiDAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDAR "LIDAR - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")

So there you have it… the *must use* remote sensing techniques for 2008! I'm sure I've missed some though.
