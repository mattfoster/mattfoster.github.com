Recently, I've needed to write and use various Makefiles. I was disappointed to find the TM's syntax highlighting lacking, and just not colourful enough, so I set about adding a few bits and pieces.

You can find the result on [GitHub](http://github.com/mattfoster/make.tmbundle/tree/master "mattfoster's make.tmbundle at master - GitHub").

I was pleased to find that most of the official TM bundles are now there, so if you're making small (or massive) tweaks and improvements, it's should now be easier than ever to get your changes merged into TM proper.
