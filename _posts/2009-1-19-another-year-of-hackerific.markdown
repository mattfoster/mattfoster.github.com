2008 was an eventful year for hackerific, I entered my second year of blogging in October (and nearly didn't notice), started posting more on TextMate and Python, and discovered and got involved with loads of cool projects.

I had originally intended to write a 'year in review' type of post, but instead of something retrospective, I've decided to talk about things I'd like to accomplish *this year*. Here the list:

 * Lots more work and posting on the [IPython TextMate Bundle](http://www.ohloh.net/p/ipython-tmbundle "IPython TextMate Bundle"). A quick google reveal an entire page of links related to this project, and it's only just started! I'm hoping that this year we'll get all of the bits I listed in my [future directions](/2008/12/9/ipython-textmate-bundle-future-directions "hackerific: IPython TextMate Bundle: Future Directions") post sorted, and lots more besides. In particular, the twisted based server should allow lots more functionality. You can find lots more info about this bundle in the [announcement post](http://www.hackerific.net/2008/11/14/announcing-the-ipython-textmate-bundle "hackerific: Announcing the IPython TextMate Bundle"). I'd encourage you to fork the [project](http://github.com/mattfoster/ipython-tmbundle "mattfoster's ipython-tmbundle at master - GitHub") on github and join the mailing list to get involved.
 * More features in the [Plain Text Wiki TextMate](http://github.com/mattfoster/plaintextwiki-tmbundle "mattfoster's plaintextwiki-tmbundle at master - GitHub") bundle. I'm still trying to change my habits to use this bundle more effectively, and I'm beginning to get there. It's also been noticed by some other people, notably [Marcelo Alvim](http://github.com/malvim "malvim's Profile - GitHub") who's hacked in support for absolute links and subdirectories. 
 * [tm-terminal](http://github.com/mkhl/tm-terminal/tree/master "mkhl's tm-terminal at master - GitHub") looks like a cool idea. It's a command that injects TextMate's environment into a terminal to help you code commands. I'm planning on extending it to work with my shell of choice, [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/ "Zsh").
 * Fix the online help commands in the Gnuplot bundle. This is *still* on my todo list.
 * Screencasts! Based on the success of my previous screencasts, I plan to make more! At the moment, I have ideas on screencasts for the gnuplot and IPython bundles. It's unbelievably fun, and takes ages though, so it may be a while before I get around to it.
 * Other fun, useful or interesting things as I find them -- this goes without saying!
 * Finish my PhD thesis. I know this is not particularly related to this blog (apart from that it's eating all of my time), but this is a fairly large chunk of my life. Once I'm done I should have plenty more free time to hack and blog to my hearts contentâ€¦ once I've got a [job](http://work.hackerific.net) that is. If you know of any work in the South West of England that you think I might be particularly suitable for, drop me an [email](mailto:&#x6D;&#x61;&#x74;&#x74;&#x2E;&#x70;&#x2E;&#x66;&#x6F;&#x73;&#x74;&#x65;&#x72;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6D;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x2E;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;), I'd really appreciate it!

Feel free to leave comments below, and here's to a great 2009.
