As my blog still has a slightly dual personality, you might not see your comments listed in under the article in which you commented. This is because disqus uses the referrer to link comments to the articles, which means it things `hackerific.net` and `hackerific.net` are different. Well, they aren't, but please note that they'll only be listed if the url begins with hackerificâ€¦ sorry for any inconvenience!
