This is just a quick note to say that I've push a copy of the "MATLAB":http://www.mathworks.com/ "TextMate":http://macromates.com/ bundle to "GitHub":http://github.com/.

You can read my post on "google groups":http://groups.google.com/group/matlab-tmbundle/browse_thread/thread/13167a7acf5935b5, or just hit the "site":http://github.com/mattfoster/matlab-tmbundle/tree/master.

Happy forking!
