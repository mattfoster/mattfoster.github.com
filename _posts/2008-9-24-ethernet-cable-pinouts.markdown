After searching for a while for a decent vector image of ethernet cable pinouts, and coming up short, I decided it was time to draw my own.

I based them on [this](http://technical.philex.com/networks/web/explain/images/cabst.jpg "Ethernet cable pinout"), which I happen to find the simplest to follow, and drew them in [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/ "The Omni Group - OmniGraffle").
