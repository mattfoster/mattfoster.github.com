This morning I was reading this [tutorial](http://code.enthought.com/projects/chaco/docs/html/user_manual/tutorial_2.html "Modelling Van Der Waal&#8217;s Equation With Chaco &mdash; Chaco v3.0.0 documentation") on Chaco, a 2-D visualisation toolkit for Python (it's part of the [enthought python distribution](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php "Enthought Python Distribution :: Products :: Enthought, Inc.")), and I wanted a toy project to get a feel for it. 

I decided to put together a very quick model of [amplitude modulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation "Amplitude modulation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"), the kind of thing elec-eng students cover early in their degrees. 

I came up with this:

<div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/mattfoster/4a5j/am-demo"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20081105-hmh24s6m5gdesirrxgrxsuieq.preview.jpg" alt="AM Demo" /></a><br /><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080">Uploaded with <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>'s <a href="http://skitch.com">Skitch</a>!</span></div>

It's very heavily based on the code in the tutorial above, but it works well, and it looks and feels pretty cool. 

I find this kind of app very useful for helping me get a *feel* for how something works, and using something like chaco in this way makes it very easy to throw quick models together to play with. 

My next challenge to to find something *useful* to do with it!

Here's the code:
