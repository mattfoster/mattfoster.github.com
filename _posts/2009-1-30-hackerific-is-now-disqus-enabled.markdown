I've just enabled [disqus](http://disqus.com/ "DISQUS | Turn Blog Comments into a Webwide Discussion with a Powerful Comment System") support in the blog template. Now, instead of the mephisto form, you should see a disqus one.

I'm hoping this should speed up the commenting process, and make it easier for discussions to happen. So please, comment away!
