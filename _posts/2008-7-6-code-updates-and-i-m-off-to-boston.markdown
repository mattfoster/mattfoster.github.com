I've just added a new repository to [GitHub](http://github.com/ "Secure Git hosting and collaborative development &mdash; GitHub"), called [octave-scattered-image](http://github.com/mattfoster/octave-scattered-image "mattfoster's octave-scattered-image at master &mdash; GitHub"), into which I've started cleaning up, and pushing my Octave functions for processing scattered image data. Have a look, and feel free to contribute. My current plan is to distribute it as an octave package, but that's currently untested. 

Also, in other news, I'm off to Boston this week, for [IGARSS 2008](http://www.igarss08.org/ "IEEE International Geoscience &amp; Remote Sensing Symposium"), the first conference of my PhD. The only disadvantage of this jaunt, is that I have to present a paper. I'll put the sides up when I get back, provided I wasn't laughed/heckled off the stage! Wish me luck!
