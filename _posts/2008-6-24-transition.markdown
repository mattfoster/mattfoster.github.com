## I've Moved to Mephisto!

After a nasty database accident, caused by too little coffee, and too much stupidity, I've decided to transition my site to mephisto. Entirely.

I've copied all of my blog posts, turned off typo, and removed radiant. This means that pretty much all of my URIs have changed, and my blog subdomain has been retired.

I'm hoping that this ultra-modern, highly slick beast will help me keep my site running smoothly, without breaking everything all the time! Especially since services like [flickr](http://flickr.com) and [GitHub](http://github.com) are making many things that used to dumped on websites obsolete.
